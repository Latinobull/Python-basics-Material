# Mini Project

## Description

Here is a terminal dictionary where the user can enter a word and retrieve the definition. If the user misenters a word, then the terminal will ask the user if they wanted to search for a word similar to the word they typed.

## Which file should I use

The project.py file is the starter code where you can practice how to write the code.

The project-finished.py file is where you can see the finished result.

## Bonus

In the project-finished.py file, there is a bonus if you can style the output of the files to be more user-friendly.
