## Learning the Basics

to check if you have python installed in your computer enter this command in your terminal or command prompt

Windows

```cmd
py --version
```

Mac

```cmd
$ python3 --version
```

If you have a version number for example 3.8.2, then you have python installed. If you don't have a version number or an error pops up, you don't have python installed.

Please refer to the following links to download Python.

# Understanding the Python Shell

Once you have python installed, you can write python directly in your terminal by typing

On Windows

```cmd
$ py
```

On Mac

```cmd
$ python3
```

Once you are in the shell, you can write up your own python code and learn through all the built in functions inside the python library

Please refer to directory.py file in order to look up the directory and how to find built functions for each datatype!

## Exiting the Shell

In order to exit the python shell write the command

```cmd
$ exit()
```

and you will be back in your terminal/git bash

## Running python files

In order to run the Python code that you write in VS code, you need to run them in your terminal or gitbash.

**You can not run your entire file in the python shell so please open a new terminal or exit out the python shell before running your code.**

To run a python file enter this command in your terminal

Windows

```cmd
$ py <fileName>
```

Mac

```cmd
$ python3 <fileName>
```
